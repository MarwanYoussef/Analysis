# Analysis and Design Of Algorithms

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is an open source Java graph Library implemented on the concept of adjacency matrix.
# It covers algorithms of Graph Theory; shortest paths and others.

Examples: Adding Nodes, Adding Paths between nodes, Deleting exisiting nodes Paths.
          Some shortest path algorithms such as Floyd Warshall and others.

Project is done for Analysis and Design of Algorithms course during the winter 2018 semester
at the German University in Cairo under supervision of Dr. Wael Aboulsaadat.
