<h1>Analysis and Design Of Algorithms</h1>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*This is an open source Java graph Library implemented on the concept of adjacency matrix.*

This library feature very useful features and algorithms that are complex to implement from scratch.

The Graph Library included many complex algorithms such shortest path, BFS, DFS and Floyd Warshall
algorithms and much more algorithms about graph theory!

Project is done for *CSEN70X: Analysis and Design of Algorithms* course during the winter 2018 semester
at the German University in Cairo under supervision of Dr. Wael Aboulsaadat.
